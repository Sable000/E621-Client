# E621-Client
A Kotlin and Java client for the e621 api. Made to be easy to use and to allow dynamic weighting to minimize and best get around the issues caused by the apis crazy strict ratelimiting.

Personally I only need this client to support retrieving post information. If you need other functionality please feel free to leave an issue or to make a PR to add more functionality.
